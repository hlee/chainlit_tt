# Chainlit Framework

Chainlit is a Python framework for building conversational AI applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with language models and other AI components.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive UI**: Chainlit provides a chat-like interface out of the box, making it easy to build conversational applications.

2. **Integration with LLMs**: It seamlessly integrates with popular language models and frameworks like OpenAI, LangChain, and more.

3. **Message Elements**: Support for rich message elements like images, PDFs, and other file types.

4. **Feedback Collection**: Built-in mechanisms for collecting user feedback.

5. **Session Management**: Maintains user session state across interactions.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG combines retrieval-based methods with generative AI to enhance the quality and accuracy of responses.

### How RAG Works

1. **Indexing**: Documents are processed and indexed for efficient retrieval.
2. **Retrieval**: When a query is received, relevant documents are retrieved from the index.
3. **Generation**: The retrieved documents are used as context for the language model to generate a response.

### Benefits of RAG

- Improves accuracy by grounding responses in factual information
- Reduces hallucinations common in pure generative models
- Enables access to specific knowledge not present in the model's training data
- Provides citations and references for generated information
